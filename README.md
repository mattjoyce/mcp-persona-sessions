# mcp-persona-sessions

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that enables AI assistants to conduct structured, persona-driven sessions including interview preparation, personal reflection, and coaching conversations.

## Overview

Transform your AI interactions with realistic persona-driven sessions. Originally designed for mock interview preparation (practice with your "new boss" before that important meeting), this MCP server has evolved into a flexible framework for guided conversations of all kinds.

Whether you're preparing for a crucial presentation, seeking structured self-reflection, or wanting to practice difficult conversations in a safe environment, this server provides the framework for meaningful, guided dialogue.

## Key Features

- üé≠ **Persona-Driven Sessions**: Load detailed persona profiles that completely transform AI behavior and expertise
- ‚è±Ô∏è **Built-in Timer Management**: Track session duration with start, stop, and status checking
- üìã **Structured Frameworks**: Pre-defined session templates with clear goals and outcomes  
- üîÑ **Adaptive Flow**: Sessions that respond to what emerges naturally in conversation
- üìä **Session Evaluation**: Get detailed feedback on performance and communication effectiveness
- üîí **Secure Operation**: Safe file handling with path validation and error handling

## Session Types

### Meeting Preparation
Practice conversations with realistic personas:
- **Healthcare CIO**: Technical discussions with mission-driven leadership perspective

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- MCP-compatible AI assistant (Claude Desktop, etc.)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mcp-persona-sessions.git
cd mcp-persona-sessions
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Set up configuration:
```bash
cp config.yaml.example config.yaml
# Edit config.yaml with your preferences
```

### MCP Client Configuration

Add to your MCP client configuration (e.g., Claude Desktop):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "persona-sessions": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["/path/to/mcp-persona-sessions/mcp-persona-sessions.py"],
      "cwd": "/path/to/mcp-persona-sessions"
    }
  }
}
```

## Usage

### Basic Session Flow

1. **Browse Available Sessions**
   ```
   Use list_session_frameworks to see available session types
   ```

2. **Explore Personas**
   ```
   Use list_session_personas to see available personas
   Use get_persona_details to understand a specific persona
   ```

3. **Start a Session**
   ```
   Use assess_session_readiness to check prerequisites
   Use initialize_session to begin with your chosen persona
   ```

4. **Manage Time**
   ```
   Use start_timer to begin session timing
   Use check_timer_status to monitor progress
   Use stop_timer to conclude
   ```

5. **Get Feedback**
   ```
   Use get_session_feedback to analyze session performance
   ```

### Example: Meeting Preparation

```
1. "I need to prepare for a meeting with our new CIO about a project proposal"
2. Browse session frameworks ‚Üí Select "General Meeting Preparation"
3. Browse personas ‚Üí Select "Healthcare CIO" 
4. Initialize session with project context
5. Practice your presentation and Q&A
6. Get detailed feedback on your responses
```

### Example: Personal Reflection

2. Select "Adaptive Personal Reflection" framework
3. Start with "Reflective Companion" persona
4. Explore creative tension, project patterns, decision-making
5. Receive transcript for future reference
```

## Configuration

### config.yaml

```yaml
persona_path: "roles"                           # Directory containing persona files
session_types_file: "session_types.yaml"       # Session framework definitions
default_persona_file: "Role-Interviewer-mcp.md" # Fallback persona
evaluator_persona_file: "Role-Interview-Evaluator.md" # Feedback persona
```

### Adding Custom Personas

Create a new `.md` file in the `roles/` directory with:

```markdown
# Your Persona Name

## Identity and Purpose
[Define who this persona is and their role]

## Communication Style
[How they speak and interact]

## Expertise Areas
[What they know and focus on]

## Goals
[What they aim to achieve in sessions]

[Additional sections as needed...]
```

### Adding Custom Session Types

Edit `session_types.yaml` to add new session frameworks:

```yaml
session_types:
  - name: "Your Custom Session"
    persona: "Your Persona"
    persona_file: "Role-Your-Persona.md"
    description: "What this session accomplishes"
    prerequisites: ["What's needed to start"]
    duration: 20
    topics: ["Key areas to explore"]
    goals: ["Session outcomes"]
```
